# WebTopic
## Introduction
WebTopic is a [rqt_graph] (http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph) like interface, but in your browser.

It's intended to help developers to see and interact with the messages going through the ROS nodes. Usually robots are on the run, so you can follow them while watching the messages on your phone. That's why WebTopic was designed thinking on mobile's screens, however it will also work in your laptop or desktop computer.

## A little bit more about WebTopic
### How does it works?
It's pretty similar to rqt_graph and the topic_monitor plugin of rqt. Most of the core use the same or variations of the functions used there. The main difference is the interface, instead of using python qt interface we provide a HTML interface suitable for mobile devices and computers.

[Flask] (http://flask.pocoo.org/) is being used as web framework and [Werkzeug] (http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) as WebServer. 

### Why did you write it?
This software was initially developed as the main project in CC-5407 - "Software Engineering for Robotics", a semestral course at the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Universidad de Chile. And was written trying to make the debug process of a moving robot easier.

## Features
